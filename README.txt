################## FreeMS2 - Free & Open Source MegaSquirt 2 ##################

This firmware is intended to run on B&G and compatible MS2 hardware using an
MS2Extra style pin arrangement. Initial functionality will be to operate the
standard MS2 output channels in a manner suitable for testing circuits and
injectors etc. This README will be updated with new progress.

Before going any further, please ensure you have the latest release or latest
code by visiting :

http://github.com/fredcooke/FreeMS2

Note, this code-base is entirely from-scratch and contains absolutely no code
from previous MegaSquirt projects, including but not limited to MS2Extra.

To find out why this project exists please see the WHY.txt file in ./docs/
To read about what this project will and won't support see the file
DesignDecisions.txt also in ./docs/ For other sources of information see the
file INFO.txt which, again, is also in the ./docs/ directory.

Please email me with any and all feedback on code, documentation, the system,
anything at all, even subtle and minor stuff:

Thanks for playing with FreeMS2 :-)

Good luck and regards,

Fred.
