An explanation :

You may be wondering why I have chosen to start this project when the current
MS2Extra firmware does such a good job of running engines. There are a few
reasons for this:

1) To provide a Free and Open Source alternative for use with the well tested
   and documented MegaSquirt hardware family.
2) To ensure that there is always a from-source firmware option available for
   MS2 users and their vehicles.
3) To provide something simple and cleanly written for people to modify for
   their own purposes that will remain free (libre and gratis) into the future.
4) For free software and open source purists.
5) To allow unrestricted modification and improvement of MegaSquirt hardware.

It is worth reading the information at this page:
