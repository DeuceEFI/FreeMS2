/**
 * RPM Calculations:
 *
 * Either need a per decoder function that is called from the main loop OR...
 * RPM calculation is done in real time inside one of the RPM interrupts OR...
 * The choice of either, up to the decoder to decide how it is done, in this
 * case the function can either do nothing, or swap some pointers/var values
 * around or similar.
 *
 * MAP Sampling:
 *
 * Max number of samples = max number of cylinders, has to be handled by decoder due to
 * potential mismatch between wheel pattern and cylinder firing pattern.
 *
 * Scheduling:
 *
 * Fueling pins could be expected to fire once per cylinder event (1 - 12), or
 * once per engine cycle, or something in between, but what is a reasonable
 * max, and is it workable to allow some cases and not others?
 *
 * Ignition pins will only need to be fired once per cycle or twice per cycle,
 * unless multi-spark startup is required, however this could be done with
 * cascaded dwell events, timer self-set:
 *
 * on dwell off spark on dwell off spark on dwell off and disable spark
 *
 * This example is for triple spark, 2 or more than 3 are also possible.
 *
 * OLD notes:
 *
 * arrays of output channels, iterate and check for wheel event number, if matched, fire:
 * doesn't allow for firing a pin more than once a cycle!! no use.
 * allows multi channel on a single wheel event (virtually useless) but is slow, one loop
 * and array per type of output channel.
 *
 * array of wheel events, do lookup for wheel event, then if output channel valid, schedule it.
 * single channel per tooth event (acceptable, wire in parallel if required), fast, memory hog,
 * need one array per type of channel, array length = max expected tooth count! do we need to
 * support every single tooth on a nissan 360 style decoder or just cyl event count, what about
 * porsche 130? next stop is 60, seems good. can we use bit-fields to save memory, 1 bit =
 * 2 possible pins, 2 bits = 4, etc, this will be slower, though. probably just an unsigned char[]
