Adjust core init values to suit ms2 clock setup etc
Simplify init by commenting out calls to sub parts except bare essentials
Migrate to correct header/register structure
Adjust memory references in the Makefile
Adjust memory references in the linker scripts
Severely cut back on memory usage, migrating everything to flash temporarily
Modify comms to not use big buffers
Update location IDs to match reality
Modify flash write stuff to not use big buffer

Figure out a paging mechanism:

Probably just tune one thing at a time and burn it before tuning some other
thing. Use pointers to either point at flash or live RAM data if available.

Configure the ADC setup correctly, and assign to internal vars.
Rearrange the port T channels to align with MS2Extra usage.
