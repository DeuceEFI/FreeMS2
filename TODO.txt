Adjust memory references in the Makefile, linker scripts, headers - mostly done, double check/fix.
Fix up assembly header and/or code to be correct and possibly even work.
Fix register usage in timers, currently configuring random pins etc.
Setup very simple echo style comms that have no brains at all.
Severely cut back on memory usage, migrating everything to flash temporarily
Modify comms to not use big buffers
Update location IDs to match reality
Modify flash write stuff to not use big buffer

Fix and modify various things commented out in order to get it to build and run:

all references to RPAGE
all references to tablesA-D
commented out calls to comms, fuel, vars stuff

Figure out a paging mechanism:

Probably just tune one thing at a time and burn it before tuning some other
thing. Use pointers to either point at flash or live RAM data if available.

Configure the ADC setup correctly, and assign to internal vars.
